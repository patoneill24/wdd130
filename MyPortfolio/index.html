            <p>Hello, I’m Patrick O’Neill! Welcome to my portfolio website. I’ve created this site to display my resume for potential employers to look at. It provides details concerning my work experience and educational accomplishments as well as some skills and  attributes I have developed over the years. This website can also provide helpful ideas for people who are trying to build their own resumes.</p>
            <p>This site contains information concerning the many qualifications that I have as well as some things that I can contribute to a business. I’m very passionate about my professional career, and the information available in this website will illustrate that. </p>
