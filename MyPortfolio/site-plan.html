      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        In 2020 I graduated form Ann Sobrato High School as an honor roll student for all 4 years. My GPA has always been between a 3.8-4.0 as I have always taken great care in my studies, and I’ve always put forth my best effort in these classes. Currently at the moment I am seeking for higher education as I am enrolled at BYU-Idaho with a major in computer science with a 4.0 GPA as well. Education is something that is very important for me and I find a lot of joy in it.  I really enjoy critical thinking and problem solving because it helps me to learn and grow as a person.
